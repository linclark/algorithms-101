algorithms-101
==============

A NodeSchool workshopper to introduce JS developers to algorithms.

This is based on [Princeton's Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI). Video lectures present the information, then you code the algorithm.

Types of algorithms covered are:
- union-find
- sorting algorithms
- priority queues
- binary search trees, etc
